# doccy-nim
the classic game terrifyingly made with emojis.

## what in fresh hell is this
i wanted to prove the amazing job-securing abilities of making everything in emojis. eventually i will be making the program(s) smaller, casting everything to pointers and making the pointers in emoji.
yes, that also means emoji memory addressing.

## what do you have left to do?
in order from highest priority to lowest:

0. cast functions to pointers
1. cast variables to pointers
2. make all pointers in emoji
3. change memory addresses to unicode emoji addresses
4. make any remaining non-emoji characters in remainder emoji addresses (modulo plan)
5. write new header files in emoji (stdio.h)
6. force user input to be emoji memory addresses (unicode alt combo)
7. eliminate whitespace by writing whitespace to emoji pointers
8. obtain CEO rank at current company i work for by making everything secure in emoji assembler language
